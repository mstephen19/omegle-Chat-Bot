# OmegleChatBot

A chat bot that spams a particular message to hundreds of people within minutes.
More specifically, this bot takes the user's message, automatically sends it to a stranger on [omegle.com](https://omegle.com), disconnects from that chat session, and starts all over again.

# Why create this bot in the first place?

## This bot has many uses. To name a few:

1. Self-promotion (music/SoundCloud, art, Twitch, software, etc.)
2. Spreading information (doxxing, spreading a message/image)
3. Spreading social media links (SnapChat, Kik, etc.)
4. Growing a group/userbase (Discord)
